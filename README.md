This is made using django for amfoss club members to buy tshirts :smile:<br>
I have added Google pay to this project.<br>
First clone the repo (after starring :smirk:)<br>
```git clone https://github.com/iammarco11/amfoss_tshirts.git ```<br>
Then start a virtual environment<br>
```virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 online```<br>
**Note**
Here online is the name of the virtualenv. <br>
Activate the virtualenv<br>
```source online/bin/activate```<br>

then go to the directory amfoss_tshirts and install all the packages <br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```<br>
 and run 
```python manage.py migrate```<br>
And then to host the server<br>
```python manage.py runserver```


I have hosted the website through heroku
